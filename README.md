# Budget Tracker Application

## Team:
- Rashmi: Incident Response Plan
- Brody: Release and README
- Irene: WIKI
- Josh: Final Security Review

## Installation

First, [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).

Second, go to our GitHub repository, and click the "Clone or download" button to download your new GitHub repo to your local file system.

Third, cd into the app/ directory of your local copy of the repo, and install third party libraries with:

```
$ meteor npm install
```

## Running the system

Once the libraries are installed, you can run the application by invoking the "start" script in the [package.json file](https://github.com/RashmiAR/BudgetTracker/blob/master/app/package.json):

```
$ meteor npm run start
```
## Developer Notes
Throught the development and release of our application, we found testing and diagnosing potential vulnerabilities to be the most difficult part. Development of our application was easy. However, learning how to break our applications security features was difficult as there are no guides on hacking into our program.
